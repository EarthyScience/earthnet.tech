DEEP EXTREMES is part of the ESA AI4SCIENCE activity. The first AI4SCIENCE ITT was launched in 2021 and had a focus on Extreme Events, Multi-Hazards and Compound Events, and contributes to the ESA Extremes and Natural Disasters Science Cluster.

The ESA AI4SCIENCE ITT had 2 main objectives:

1. **Advancing Earth System Science**: advancing our capacity to combine EO and AI to address a major scientific challenge: The observation, understanding and characterisation of multi-hazards, compound and cascade events and its impacts on society and ecosystems.
2. **Advancing Artificial Intelligence for EO**: unlocking the full potential of Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Science with focus on two main AI challenges: physics-driven Artificial Intelligence and explainable AI.
The DEEP EXTREMES project has a focus on compound heat and drought events at global scale, looking at detection based on long-term climate and land-surface data, combining EO archives and other observation data, with methods tailored to multivariate event detection.

The principle is to start from sampling a subset of large events in Sentinel era and zooming into the events and in unaffected areas around the event with high-dimensional “mini cubes”.

The activity then aims to train complementary deep-learning methods for prediction and understanding dynamics in such events, implement the tested and validated workflow in a cloud environment and developing it further based on community feedback. Science community engagement is planned via workshops and science discussions to further develop the proposed framework.
