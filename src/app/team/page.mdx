The EarthNet team at the [Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/) and [ELLIS Unit Jena](ellis-jena.eu/) is an cross-cutting activity at the [Biogeochemical Integration Department](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/bgi/home) lead by Markus Reichstein.  
We are an interdisciplinary group of Computer Scientists, Ecologists, Environmental Engineers, Geographers, Mathematicians and Physicists interested in the applications of machine learning to Earth System Science. In particular we explore how large deep neural networks can be leveraged to improve the resilience of our society in the wake of rising climate extremes, by improving impact-based forecasting and early warning systems.
