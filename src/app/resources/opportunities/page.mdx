<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center -mb-6">Join Us on a mission to a more climate resilient future!</h1>
<div></div>


We are constantly looking for mission-driven lovers of machine learning, remote sensing and ecosystem science. Our team includes people with a multitude of backgrounds, both culturally and professionally. We value the diversity and strive to learn from everybodys perspective. Our work involves cooperation with partners from national, European and international institutions - including those outside of Academia, such as international NGOs like the World Food Programme or the Red Cross.


<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center -mb-6">Interns and Master Students</h1>
<div></div>
We have supervised multiple internships and thesis, and some of our favorite colleagues started this way. If you would like to come work with us in Jena or remotely, please reach out by e-mail with your CV and transcripts and a first description what kind of project you would be most interested in.

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center -mb-6">PhD candidates</h1>
<div></div>
PhD candidates at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and ELLIS Unit Jena are typically hired through one of two programs:

1. [IMPRS-gBGC](https://www.imprs-gbgc.de/) - for candidates with a background in Earth System science
2. [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) - for candidates from quantiative fields with prior experience in machine learning

Please consider applying to either one of those two programs.  
We are also happy to receive unsolicited applications by e-mail, but can not promise positions outside of the programs to be available. Please reach out by including your CV, transcripts, master thesis or prior publications and a research statement.

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center -mb-6">PostDoc candidates</h1>
<div></div>
Interested in pursuing postdoctoral research with the EarthNet team? We regularly partake in third-party funded research projects and resulting job opportunities are posted on the [MPI BGC job board](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/jobs).  
We are also interested in applying jointly for postdoctral fellowships and explore other funding opportunities.  
Thus we'd be happy to hear from you by e-mail, including your CV, a publication list and a research statement.
