## B. Web analysis
## 1. Type of data

Every time our website is accessed, our system logs the following data and information from the computer system of the accessing device:

- Name and version of the operating system
- Name, version and language setting of the browser.

The following data are collected additionally if JavaScript is activated:

- URLs visited on this website
- Times of page visits
- Type of HTML requests

- Technologies and formats supported by the browser (e.g. cookies, Java, Flash, PDF, WindowsMedia, QuickTime, Realplayer, Director, SilverLight, Google Gears).
- The saving and analysis of data is carried out solely on a central server operated by the MPG.

It goes without saying that you have the opportunity to object to your data being collected. The following independent methods are available to you if you wish to object to data collection by the central server:

In your browser, activate the Do-Not-Track setting. As long as this setting is active, our central server will not save any of your data. Important: Do-Not-Track generally only applies to the one device and browser on which the setting is activated. If you use several devices/browsers, you must activate Do-Not-Track separately on each one.
Use our opt-out function. Click on the check mark in the following selection box under https://www.mpg.de/datenschutzhinweis/datenerhebung-deaktivieren in order to stop or reactivate data collection. As long as the selection box is deactivated, our central server will not save any of your data. Important: For the opt-out, we have to store a special recognition cookie in your browser. If you delete this or use a different PC/browser, you have to object to data collection once again on this page.
There is no storage of these data together with other personal data relating to the users.

## 2. Legal basis

The processing of the users' personal data enables us to analyze the usage behaviour of our users. By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information on the use of the individual components of our websites. This helps us improve our websites and their user-friendliness on an ongoing basis. These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR as well as § 25, para. 2, no. 2 TDDDG. By anonymizing the IP address, the users' interest in the protection of their personal data is sufficiently taken into account.

## 3. Data deletion
The data are deleted after the final annual totals have been arrived at for access statistics.

## C. Measures for the secure use of forms
## 1. Prevention of the misuse of forms
### a. Type of data
To prevent any misuse of forms, the Friendly Captcha function is used. Friendly Captcha serves to exclude mass machine use of the forms offered:

- Newsletter sign-up,  
- Contact form,  
- Registration for subscription management.  

When a form containing Friendly Captcha widget is called up, a puzzle request will be automatically sent from the user´s device. In the course of this process, the following log data is collected by Friendly Captcha:

- The request headers User-Agent, Origin and Referer.
- The puzzle itself, which contains information about the account and site key it is related to.
- The version of the widget.
- A timestamp

Friendly Captcha stores an anonymized counter per IP address for dynamic puzzle difficulty on the edge network to detect malicious users and minimize blocking legitimate users. This data is stored entirely separately from the rest of the data and cannot be correlated to specific websites or anything else. We anonymize IP addresses using a one-way hash of certain values so they cannot be personally identified.

Within the use of Friendly Captcha, no other information or personal data, such as your name, email address and online profiles, will be asked for.

### b. Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing of personal data by means of Friendly Captcha is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR as well as § 25, para. 2, no. 2 TDDDG. Friendly Captcha is used to ensure the functional capability of the forms and prevent their misuse. These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The use of Friendly Captcha is absolutely necessary in order to operate the mentioned forms. It is therefore not possible for the user to object.

### c.Data deletion
The data collected when using Friendly Captcha is anonymized.

## 2. Securing communication through forms
### a. Type of data
To protect the integrity of the data entered into a form while the form is being transmitted, a digital token is retrieved from the MPG servers and transmitted back when the completed form is submitted. The token is not stored on the users’ devices.

The token csrf_token is used to secure the communication through the following forms:

- Newsletter sign-up,
- Contact form,
- Registration for subscription management

### b. Legal basis
The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR as well as § 25, para. 2, no. 2 TDDDG . The token is used to ensure the security of communication through forms and prevent misuse. These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The use of the token is absolutely necessary in order to operate the mentioned forms. It is therefore not possible for the users to object.

### c. Data deletion
The MPG does not store any data when using the token.

## D. Data transmission
The management and storage of your personal details is carried out by selected services

within the scope of commissioned data processing on systems of our service providers.
